.SH NAME
mosh \- mobile shell with roaming and intelligent local echo
.SH SYNOPSIS

[user@]host

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmosh\fP (mobile shell) is a remote terminal application that
supports intermittent connectivity, allows roaming, and provides
speculative local echo and line editing of user keystrokes.

Compared with \fBssh\fP, \fBmosh\fP is more robust \(em its
connections stay up across sleeps and changes in the client's IP
address \(em and more responsive, because the protocol is tolerant of
packet loss and the client can echo most keystrokes immediately,
without waiting for a network round-trip.

\fBmosh\fP uses \fBssh\fP to establish a connection to the remote host
and authenticate with existing means (e.g., public-key authentication
or a password). \fBmosh\fP executes the unprivileged \fBmosh-server\fP
helper program on the server, then closes the SSH connection and
starts the \fBmosh-client\fP, which establishes a long-lived datagram
connection over UDP.

To improve responsiveness, \fBmosh\fP runs a predictive model of the
server's behavior in the background, trying to guess the effect of
each keystroke on the screen. It makes predictions for normal typing,
backspace, and the left- and right-arrow keys. When it is confident,
\fBmosh\fP displays the predictions without waiting for the
server. The predictive model must prove itself anew on each row of the
terminal and after each control character, so \fBmosh\fP avoids
echoing passwords or non-echoing editor commands.

By default, \fBmosh\fP shows its predictions only on high-latency
connections and to smooth out network glitches. (On longer-latency
links, the predicted cells are underlined until confirmed by the
server.) Occasional echo mistakes are corrected within a network
round-trip and do not cause lasting effect.

\fBmosh\fP does not support X forwarding or the non-interactive uses
of SSH, including port forwarding or sshfs. \fBmosh\fP works through
typical client-side network address translators but requires UDP to
pass between client and server. By default, \fBmosh\fP uses the ports
between 60000 and 61000, but allows the user to request a particular
UDP port instead.

\fBmosh\fP will do its best to arrange a UTF-8 character set locale on
the client and server. The client must have locale-related environment
variables that specify UTF-8. \fBmosh\fP will pass these client
variables to the \fBmosh-server\fP on its command line, but in most
cases they will not need to be used. \fBmosh-server\fP first attempts
to use its own locale-related environment variables, which come from
the system default configuration (sometimes /etc/default/locale) or
from having been passed over the SSH connection. But if these
variables don't call for the use of UTF-8, \fBmosh-server\fP will
apply the locale-related environment variables from the client and try
again.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \fIcommand\fP
Command to run on remote host. By default, \fBmosh\fP executes a login shell.

.TP
.B \-\-client=\fIPATH\fP
path to client helper on local machine (default: "mosh-client")

.TP
.B \-\-server=\fICOMMAND\fP
command to run server helper on remote machine (default: "mosh-server")

The server helper is unprivileged and can be installed in the user's
home directory.

.TP
.B \-\-ssh=\fICOMMAND\fP
OpenSSH command to remotely execute mosh-server on remote machine (default: "ssh")

An alternate ssh port can be specified with, \fIe.g.\fP, \-\-ssh="ssh \-p 2222".

.TP
.B \-\-predict=\fIWHEN\fP
Controls use of speculative local echo. WHEN defaults to `adaptive'
(show predictions on slower links and to smooth out network glitches)
and can also be `always` or `never'.

The MOSH_PREDICTION_DISPLAY environment variable controls this setting
permanently and can adopt the same three values.

Even on `always', \fBmosh\fP will only show predictions when it is
confident. This generally means a previous prediction on the same row
of the terminal has been confirmed by the server, without any
intervening control character keystrokes.

.TP
.B \-a
Synonym for \-\-predict=always

.TP
.B \-n
Synonym for \-\-predict=never

.TP
.B --family=\fIFAMILY\fP
Force the use of a particular address family, which defaults to `inet'
(IPv4), and can also be `inet6' (IPv6; requires IO::Socket::IP or
IO::Socket::INET6).

.TP
.B -4
Synonym for \-\-family=inet

.TP
.B -6
Synonym for \-\-family=inet6

.TP
.B \-p \fIPORT\fP[:\fIPORT2\fP], \-\-port=\fIPORT\fP[:\fIPORT2\fP]
Use a particular server-side UDP port or port range,
for example, if this is the
only port that is forwarded through a firewall to the
server. Otherwise, \fBmosh\fP will choose a port between 60000 and
61000.

.TP
.B \-\-bind\-server={ssh|any|\fIIP\fP}
Control the IP address that the \fBmosh-server\fP binds to.

The default is `ssh', in which case the server will reply from the IP
address that the SSH connection came from (as found in the
\fBSSH_CONNECTION\fP environment variable). This is useful for
multihomed servers.

With \-\-bind\-server=any, the server will reply on the default interface
and will not bind to a particular IP address. This can be useful if
the connection is made through \fBsslh\fP or another tool that makes
the SSH connection appear to come from localhost.

With \-\-bind\-server=\fIIP\fP, the server will attempt to bind to the
specified IP address.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-init
Do not send the \fBsmcup\fP initialization string and \fBrmcup\fP
deinitialization string to the client's terminal. On many terminals
this disables alternate screen mode.

.TP
.B \-\-local
Invoke \fBmosh-server\fP locally, without using \fBssh\fP.  This
option requires the \fBhost\fP argument to be a local, numeric
IPv4/IPv6 address.  This option is useful for testing.

.SH ESCAPE SEQUENCES

The default escape character used by Mosh is ASCII RS (decimal 30).
This is typically typed as \fBCtrl-^\fP or \fBCtrl-Shift-6\fP, on US
English keyboards.  Users of non-English keyboards may find it
difficult or impossible to type the default escape character, and may
need to change the escape character.  See the description of
MOSH_ESCAPE_KEY, below.  In this description, the configured escape
character is represented as \fBEsc\fP.

There are two slightly different modes for escape sequences, depending
whether the escape character is printable or not.

If the escape character is a printable character, it must be prefixed
with a newline, similar to \fBOpenSSH\fP.  To send the escape character
itself, type it twice.  If the escape character is set to \fB~\fP,
\fBmosh\fP will behave much like \fBOpenSSH\fP.

If the escape character is a non-printable control character, no
prefix is used and the escape character is recognized at any time.  To
send the escape character itself, type the escape character, then its
corresponding ASCII character (for \fBCtrl-^\fP you would type \fB^\fP,
for \fBCtrl-B\fP you would type \fBB\fP).

The escape sequence to shut down the connection is
\fBEsc .\fP. The sequence \fBEsc Ctrl-Z\fP suspends the client.
Any other sequence passes both characters through to the server.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
These variables are not actually interpreted by
.BR mosh (1)
itself, but are passed through to
.BR mosh-server (1).
They are described here for ease of use.

.TP
.B MOSH_ESCAPE_KEY
When set, this configures the escape character used for local
commands.  The escape character may be set to any ASCII character in
the range 1-127.  The variable must be set with a single literal ASCII
character.  Control characters are set with the actual ASCII
control character, not with a printable representation such as "^B".

.TP
.B MOSH_PREDICTION_DISPLAY
Controls local echo as described above.  The command-line flag
overrides this variable.

.TP
.B MOSH_TITLE_NOPREFIX
When set, inhibits prepending "[mosh]" to window title.
